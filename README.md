# 👋 Welcome to My Digital Garden

> Where code meets creativity - A software engineer's journey through bits and bytes

## 🚀 Tech Craftsmanship

Built with modern web technologies:

- **React** - For a smooth, component-based UI
- **TypeScript** - Because type safety matters
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast builds and hot reloading
- **Custom Hooks** - For clean, reusable logic

## 💡 Why Different?

I believe your portfolio should reflect how you work. As a developer who lives in VS Code, I've created an environment that feels like home – both for me and for fellow developers who visit.
